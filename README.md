## üéØ Accuracy

Rotector is designed to find inappropriate content while minimizing false flags. Here's how it works:

### Detection Process

Rotector uses two detection systems for users and groups:

#### User Detection

1. **Smart Scoring**:
   We look at different factors like friends and account details to identify inappropriate content. Our system is carefully tuned to catch both obvious and subtle patterns while avoiding false positives.

2. **AI Checks**:
   The AI uses a conservative approach - it only flags accounts when there is clear evidence of violations. While this means it might miss some borderline cases, it ensures high confidence in flagged accounts. The AI friend worker systematically analyzes friend lists of flagged accounts which has proven to be very effective.

3. **Validation Measures**:
   When the AI flags content, we always check to make sure that content really exists on the user's profile. This extra step helps us avoid mistakes and keeps our system reliable.

#### Group Detection

1. **Member Monitoring**:
   The system tracks the number of flagged users within each group. When the count of flagged members surpasses a threshold, the group is automatically flagged for review. This approach helps identify potentially inappropriate communities that may contain users engaging in inappropriate behavior.

2. **Whitelist System**:
   Popular communities such as official Roblox groups or major fan clubs may initially trigger flags due to their large user base. However, once these groups are manually reviewed and cleared by moderators, they are permanently added to a whitelist to prevent future flags. This whitelist status isn't permanent though as administrators are able to reverse this status.

> [!TIP]
> Interested in seeing how well it performs? Check out our test results in the [Efficiency](#-efficiency) section.

### What We Don't Detect

To avoid false positives, Rotector won't flag accounts for:

<details>
<summary>Just having certain friends or followers</summary>
We don't flag accounts just because they're connected to someone breaking the rules. They might have been added or followed without knowing the other person was breaking rules. However, if we find an account is part of a large network of bad accounts, we will flag it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Normal friendship conversations</summary>
Regular social interactions and friendly relationships are normal on Roblox.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Regular emojis or internet slang</summary>
Many emojis and slang words can mean different things and are often used innocently. We look at how they're being used before making any decisions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Art without inappropriate themes</summary>
Creative expression is important on Roblox. We only flag art that clearly breaks the rules.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Talking about gender or orientation</summary>
These are normal parts of personal identity. Flagging such content could unfairly target users just for being themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Normal roleplay games</summary>
Roleplaying is a big part of Roblox. We only flag roleplay that's clearly inappropriate.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Regular bad language</summary>
Normal swearing and insults are handled by Roblox's chat filters. We focus on more serious safety issues.
</details>

## ‚ö° Efficiency

Rotector is designed to be highly efficient in processing large volumes of data while maintaining reasonable resource usage. Below is a performance snapshot from one of our test runs (as of November 7, 2024).

> [!NOTE]
> These results are from a single test run and should be considered illustrative rather than definitive. Performance can vary significantly based on multiple factors like API response times, proxy performance, system resources, configuration, and more.

### Test Configuration

- Users to Scan: 500
- Workers: 3 AI friend workers
- Proxies: 250 Romanian Location
- Rate Limit: 200 requests/second

### Performance Metrics

| Metric                              | Value                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Time Taken                          | 44 minutes 32 seconds |
| **Accounts Flagged**                | **7,078**             |
| API Requests Sent                   | 74,243                |
| API Request Success Rate            | 99.86%                |
| Bandwidth Used                      | 753.48 MB             |
| OpenAI Token Cost                   | $0.16                 |
| OpenAI API Calls                    | 241                   |
| Redis Memory Usage                  | 803.92 MB             |
| Redis Key Count                     | 69,663                |
| Concurrent Goroutines (min/avg/max) | 335 / 2,428 / 4,454   |

> [!NOTE]
> At this rate, a 24-hour runtime would theoretically flag approximately **228,869 users** with AI costs of $5.17. However, the actual number of flagged users would likely decrease over time as more users are added to the database, since previously processed users would not need to be rechecked.

### Accuracy Validation

In a manual review of 100 randomly selected flagged users from this test run:

- 99 users were confirmed as correctly flagged
- 1 user was cleared due to insufficient profile information

## üîÑ Reviewing

Rotector has two different ways to review flagged accounts: one for community members and one for official moderators. This dual approach ensures both community engagement and high standards of moderation.

### Community Review Mode

Anyone can help review flagged accounts through a carefully designed training mode. To protect privacy, this mode censors user information and hides external links. Users can participate by upvoting/downvoting based on whether they think an account breaks the rules, which helps point out accounts that need urgent review.

This system helps official moderators in several ways:

- Finds the most serious cases quickly
- Gives moderators extra input for their decisions
- Helps train new moderators
- Lets the community help keep Roblox safe

### Official Review Mode

Official moderators have more tools and permissions for account review. They can:

- See all account information (unless they turn on streamer mode)
- Ask AI workers to recheck accounts
- See logs of all moderation actions
- Make changes to the database
- Switch between standard mode and training mode

What makes this mode special is that moderators can do everything needed to handle flagged accounts. While community votes help, moderators make the final decisions about what happens to flagged accounts.

This dual-system approach works well because it lets everyone help out while making sure trained moderators handle the final decisions.

<summary>What's the story behind Rotector?</summary>

Rotector started when [jaxron](https://github.com/jaxron) developed two important libraries on September 23, 2024: [RoAPI.go](https://github.com/jaxron/roapi.go) and [axonet](https://github.com/jaxron/axonet). These libraries became the backbone of Rotector's networking and API interaction capabilities.

Rotector's official development began secretly on October 13, 2024 due to his personal concerns about inappropriate behavior on Roblox and a desire to help protect young players. The project was made public for the alpha testing phase on November 8, 2024.

While Roblox already has moderators, there are so many users that it's hard to catch every inappropriate account quickly. Some Roblox staff have also acknowledged that it's difficult to handle all the reports they get. Sometimes, inappropriate accounts stay active even after being reported.

Rotector helps by finding these accounts automatically. Our goal is to make moderation easier and help keep the Roblox community, especially young players, safer.

<summary>Why is Rotector open-sourced?</summary>

We believe in transparency and the power of open source. By making our code public, anyone can understand how the tool works. It's also a great way for people to learn about online safety and moderation tools.

While we welcome feedback, ideas, and contributions, this open-source release is mainly to show how the tool works and help others learn from it.

<details>
<summary>When will the REST API be available?</summary>

The REST API will be ready during the beta phase. At this time, we're focusing on making sure the core features work well. Once those are stable, we'll work on the API so other developers can use Rotector in their own projects.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use Rotector without the Discord bot?</summary>

Yes, but the Discord bot makes reviewing accounts much easier. The main features (finding and reporting inappropriate accounts) work fine without Discord. If you don't want to use the Discord bot, you'll need to create your own way to review the accounts that get flagged.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why use Discord instead of a custom web interface?</summary>

Discord already has everything we need for reviewing accounts - buttons, dropdowns, forms, and rich embeds. Using Discord lets us focus on making Rotector better instead of building a whole new interface from scratch.

<details>
<summary>Are proxies and cookies necessary to use Rotector?</summary>

No, you don't need proxies or cookies to use Rotector. Proxies can help if you're making lots of requests, but they're optional. While cookies are mentioned in the settings, we don't use them for anything at the moment.

Proxies can be set up in the `config.toml` file. This file also includes a rate limit setting that lets you control how many requests Rotector makes to Roblox's API.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Will users who have stopped their inappropriate behavior be removed from the database?</summary>

No, past rule violations remain in the database, even if users say they've changed. This can be useful for law enforcement investigations and for future safety concerns. Some users try to clean up their profiles temporarily, only to return to breaking rules later.

This isn't about preventing second chances - it's about keeping the platform safe, especially for young users.

<summary>Who inspired the creation of Rotector?</summary>

[Ruben Sim](https://www.youtube.com/@RubenSim), a YouTuber and former game developer, helped inspire Rotector. His work exposing Roblox's moderation problems, especially through the [Moderation for Dummies](https://x.com/ModForDummies) Twitter account, showed what one person could do even without special tools. We are deeply grateful for his contributions which helped pave the way for our project.

<details>
<summary>How did "Rotector" get its name?</summary>

The name comes from three ideas:

1. **Protector**: We want to protect Roblox players from inappropriate content
2. **Detector**: We find inappropriate accounts
3. **"Ro-" prefix**: From "Roblox", the platform we work with
