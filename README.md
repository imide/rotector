### Workers

<details>
<summary>AI Friend Worker</summary>

The AI friend worker systematically analyzes user networks to identify inappropriate content and behavior patterns. Here's how it works:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start([Start Worker]) --> GetBatch[Get Next Batch<br>of Users]
    
    subgraph Processing [User Processing]
        direction TB
        subgraph DataCollection [Data Collection]

            FetchInfo --> |Parallel| GetFriends[Friends]
            FetchInfo --> |Parallel| GetGames[Games]
        end

        end

        subgraph GroupTracking [Group Tracking]
            direction LR
            TrackGroups[Track User's<br>Groups]
        end
        
        subgraph EnrichData [Data Enrichment]
            direction LR
            GetThumbnails[Fetch Thumbnails] --> GetOutfits[Fetch Outfits]
            GetOutfits --> GetFollowers[Get Follower<br>Count]
            GetFollowers --> GetFollowing[Get Following<br>Count]
        end
        
        Validation -->|Passed| GroupTracking
        GroupTracking --> EnrichData
        
        EnrichData --> PopularCheck{Popular User<br>Check}
        PopularCheck -->|Yes| HighConfidence[Set High<br>Confidence Flag]
        PopularCheck -->|No| SaveDB[(Save to<br>Database)]
        HighConfidence --> SaveDB
    end
    
    GetBatch --> Processing
    RetryQueue --> GetBatch
    SaveDB --> GetBatch
```

The worker continuously processes users in batches, with built-in safeguards:

- Pauses when flagged user count exceeds threshold
- Validates AI results against original content
- Maintains retry queue for failed validations
- Enriches flagged users with additional data for review

Going into more detail about the detection process:

1. **Smart Scoring**:
   We analyze multiple factors including friend networks, group memberships, and account information to identify patterns of inappropriate content. Our system is tuned to catch both clear and subtle violations while minimizing false positives.

2. **AI Analysis**:
   Our AI only flags accounts with evidence of violations. While this means some borderline cases might be missed, it ensures high confidence in flagged accounts.

3. **Validation System**:
   When the AI flags content, we validate that it exists on the user's profile. This extra verification step helps prevent false positives and maintains system reliability.

What We Don't Flag:

- Accounts just for having only one flagged friend/follower
- Normal friendship conversations
- Regular emojis or internet slang
- Art without inappropriate themes
- Gender/orientation discussions
- Normal roleplay activities
- Regular bad language (handled by Roblox filters)

<summary>AI Group Worker</summary>

The AI group worker analyzes group member lists to identify inappropriate accounts. Here's how it works:

        end

            GroupCheck[Check Groups<br>for Flags] --> FriendCheck[Check Friends<br>for Flags] --> Translate[Translate<br>Description] --> AICheck[AI Content<br>Analysis]

The key difference from the friend worker is that it:

- Processes members from inappropriate groups
- Uses cursor pagination to handle large member lists

Going into more detail about the detection process:

1. **Group Analysis**:
   The system tracks the groups each flagged user is in. For the groups that exceed a certain threshold of flagged members, they are flagged for review.

2. **False Positives**:
   Large groups like fan groups may be flagged due to their member count. After manual review, cleared groups are whitelisted to prevent future flags, though administrators can reverse this status if needed.

### Requests

<details>
<summary>Middleware Layers</summary>

Rotector uses a sophisticated middleware chain to ensure reliable and efficient API interactions. Here's how requests are processed:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start([API Request]) --> Layer1

    subgraph Layer1 [Layer 1: Proxy Routing]
        ProxyLayer[Load Distribution<br>Endpoint Cooldowns]
    end

    subgraph Layer2 [Layer 2: Caching]
        RedisCache[Redis Cache<br>1 Hour TTL]
    end

    subgraph Layer3 [Layer 3: Efficiency]
        SingleFlight[Single Flight<br>Deduplicates Concurrent<br>Requests]
    end

    subgraph Layer4 [Layer 4: Reliability]
        RetryLogic[Retry with<br>Exponential Backoff]
    end

    subgraph Layer5 [Layer 5: Fault Tolerance]
        CircuitBreaker[Circuit Breaker<br>Prevents Cascading Failures]
    end

    Layer1 --> Layer2
    Layer2 --> Layer3
    Layer3 --> Layer4
    Layer4 --> Layer5
    Layer5 --> RobloxAPI[(Roblox API)]

    style RobloxAPI fill:#f96,stroke:#333
```

Each layer serves a specific purpose:

1. **Proxy Routing** (Layer 1)
   - Distributes requests across multiple proxies
   - Manages endpoint-specific cooldowns per proxy
   - Helps avoid IP-based rate limits

2. **Redis Caching** (Layer 2)
   - Caches responses for 1 hour
   - Reduces load on Roblox API
   - Improves response times

3. **Request Deduplication** (Layer 3)
   - Combines identical concurrent requests
   - Reduces unnecessary API calls
   - Uses Go's singleflight pattern

4. **Retry Logic** (Layer 4)
   - Handles transient failures
   - Uses exponential backoff
   - Configurable retry limits

5. **Circuit Breaker** (Layer 5)
   - Prevents cascading failures
   - Automatic recovery after timeout
   - Configurable failure thresholds

The middleware chain processes requests, with each middleware layer adding its optimization, which ensures maximum efficiency while maintaining reliability.

### Test Analysis

#### User Detection

At the current rate, a 24-hour runtime would theoretically flag approximately **298,248 users**, with AI costing only **$3.84**. However, the number of flagged users would probably be lower as more users are added to the database. If Rotector maintained this detection rate, it could potentially flag **hundreds of thousands of inappropriate accounts in just a week**!

A brief analysis of the results shows that almost all users were flagged accurately, with some false positives, which is to be expected. These false positives are borderline cases or too vague to be considered inappropriate.

#### Group Detection

We discovered several large groups of inappropriate accounts that have managed to avoid detection by traditional moderation techniques:

- Group with 1934 flagged users (34XXXX55)
- Group with 1719 flagged users (45XXXX3)
- Group with 1680 flagged users (34XXXX41)
- Group with 1521 flagged users (65XXXX7)
- Group with 1401 flagged users (34XXXX64)
- Group with 1063 flagged users (35XXXX31)
- ... and many more with hundreds of flagged users

Smaller groups have also been identified by our detection algorithm, which also considers the percentage of flagged users in a group instead of just raw numbers. This includes small ERP communities and pools of alt account that conventional moderation methods might normally overlook. **All groups were accurately flagged with no false positives.**

#### Comparison with Previous Run

The current run displays fewer users and groups flagged compared to the previous run, which was expected as improvements were made to the detection algorithm and resulted in fewer false positives.

We've also made significant improvements to the networking side. With optimizations in request patterns and strategies, the current run used only roughly a third of the bandwidth compared to the previous run (932.09 MB vs 2.83 GB).

These results are constantly getting better as we improve the detection algorithm and networking side. However, the biggest limitation is the number of proxies available due to their high costs. These proxies are necessary as workers need to process users and gather all necessary data upfront which makes many requests per second. This pre-loading approach means that when moderators review flagged accounts, they get near-instant access to all user information without waiting for additional API requests.

With more proxies or even a special way to get past rate limits, we could potentially scan over 100 times more users per hour instead of the current rate given the current VPS resources. This would theoretically be possible as Rotector is built with performance in mind.

## üîÑ Reviewing

Rotector has two methods for reviewing flagged accounts: one designed for community members and another for official moderators. This dual approach promotes community involvement while allowing official moderators to handle the final decisions.

### Community Review Mode (Training Mode)

<p align="left"><img src="assets/gif/training_mode.gif" width="450"></p>

Anyone can assist in reviewing flagged accounts through a specially designed Training Mode. To ensure confidentiality, this mode censors user information and hides external links. Anyone can participate by upvoting/downvoting based on their assessment of whether an account violates the rules, which helps point out accounts that need urgent review by official moderators.

This system helps official moderators in several ways:

- Finds the most serious cases quickly
- Gives moderators extra input for their decisions
- Helps train new moderators

### Official Review Mode (Standard Mode)

<p align="left"><img src="assets/gif/standard_mode.gif" width="450"></p>

Official moderators have better tools and permissions for reviewing accounts. They are able to:

- Access all account information (unless they turn on streamer mode)
- Request workers to recheck accounts
- View logs of all moderation activities
- Toggle between standard mode and training mode
- Make changes to the database

What sets this mode apart is that moderators have the authority to take all necessary actions regarding flagged accounts. While community votes provide input, it is the moderators who ultimately decide the fate of these accounts.

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I set this up myself?</summary>

Detailed setup instructions will be available during the beta phase when the codebase is more stable. During alpha, we're focusing on making frequent changes, which makes maintaining documentation difficult.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the story behind Rotector?</summary>

Rotector started when [jaxron](https://github.com/jaxron) developed two important libraries on September 23, 2024: [RoAPI.go](https://github.com/jaxron/roapi.go) and [axonet](https://github.com/jaxron/axonet) which became the backbone of Rotector's networking and API interaction capabilities.

Rotector's official development began secretly on October 13, 2024, due to his concerns about inappropriate behavior on Roblox and a desire to help protect young players. The project was made public for the alpha testing phase on November 8, 2024.

While Roblox already has moderators, there are so many users that it's hard to catch every inappropriate account easily. Some Roblox staff have also acknowledged that it's difficult to handle all the reports they get. Sometimes, inappropriate accounts and groups stay active even after being reported.

Rotector helps by finding these accounts automatically. Our goal is to make moderation easier and help keep the Roblox community, especially young players, safer.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is Rotector open-sourced?</summary>

We believe in transparency and the power of open source. By making our code public, anyone can understand how the tool works and it's also a great way for people to learn about online safety and moderation tools.

While we welcome feedback, ideas, and contributions, this open-source release is mainly to show how the tool works and help others learn from it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use Rotector without the Discord bot?</summary>

Yes, but the Discord bot makes reviewing accounts much easier. The main features (finding and flagging inappropriate accounts) work fine without Discord but you'll need to create your own way to review the accounts that get flagged. All flagged users and groups are stored in the `flagged_users` and `flagged_groups` tables in the database.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why use Discord instead of a custom web interface?</summary>

Discord already has everything we need for reviewing accounts - buttons, dropdowns, forms, and rich embeds. Using Discord lets us focus on making Rotector better instead of building a whole new interface from scratch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are proxies and cookies necessary to use Rotector?</summary>

Proxies are required as Rotector makes lots of requests per second. While cookies are mentioned in the settings, we don't use them for anything at the moment.

The `config.toml` file includes cooldown settings for each endpoint that lets you control how many requests Rotector makes to Roblox's API.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Will users who have stopped their inappropriate behavior be removed from the database?</summary>

No, past rule violations remain in the database, even if users say they've changed. This can be useful for law enforcement investigations and for future safety concerns.

Some users try to clean up their profiles temporarily, only to return to breaking rules later. It isn't about preventing second chances but rather about keeping the platform safe, especially for young users.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why did Rotector switch from GPT-4o mini to Gemini?</summary>

We made the switch to Gemini because it is 4 times cheaper than GPT-4o mini, offers 5 times faster output speed, and has 2 times lower latency, while maintaining the same level of accuracy in identifying inappropriate content. This change allows us to achieve more with a smaller budget, introduce new features that were previously unaffordable, and ensure the project's long-term sustainability.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Who inspired the creation of Rotector?</summary>

[Ruben Sim](https://www.youtube.com/@RubenSim), a YouTuber and former game developer, helped inspire Rotector. His work exposing Roblox's moderation problems, especially through the [Moderation for Dummies](https://x.com/ModForDummies) Twitter account, showed what one person could do even without special tools. We are deeply grateful for his contributions which helped pave the way for our project.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How did "Rotector" get its name?</summary>

The name comes from three ideas:

1. **Protector**: We want to protect Roblox players from inappropriate content
2. **Detector**: We find inappropriate accounts
3. **"Ro-" prefix**: From "Roblox", the platform we work with
