## üéØ Accuracy

Rotector is designed to identify potentially inappropriate content while minimizing false positives. Here's an overview of its capabilities.

### Detection Capabilities

Rotector uses a conservative flagging approach to minimize false positives as the AI only raises flags when there is evidence of a violation, which means some borderline cases may be missed in favor of accuracy.

The AI friend worker stands as our most effective scanning method. It systematically goes through friend lists of flagged accounts which has proven particularly effective in uncovering hidden networks of inappropriate accounts.

To prevent AI hallucination, the system implements strict validation measures as all AI-generated content are cross-checked against actual user profile data, ensuring that flagged content actually exists.

> [!TIP]
> For detailed performance metrics and test results, see the [Efficiency](#-efficiency) section.

### What it Does Not Detect

To reduce false positives, Rotector is designed to avoid flagging:

<details>
<summary>Users solely based on their affiliations (friend/follower/following)</summary>
Affiliate-based flagging could unfairly target users who may have been added or followed unknowingly, or who connected with others before they became inappropriate accounts. Historical connections don't have enough context to determine current intent. However, if the account is found to be involved in a large network of inappropriate accounts, it will be flagged.
</details>

<details>
<summary>General mentions of friendship or relationships</summary>
Normal social interactions and platonic relationships are normal on the platform.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Non-sexual emojis or common internet slang</summary>
Many emojis and slang terms have multiple meanings and are commonly used innocently. Therefore, context is crucial, and flagging such content would lead to many false positives.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Artistic content without explicit sexual themes</summary>
Creative expression is a core part of the Roblox platform. Art should only be flagged when it clearly violates guidelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Discussions about gender identity or sexual orientation</summary>
These are legitimate parts of personal identity. Flagging such content could lead to discrimination and prevent users from expressing their authentic selves within platform guidelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary>References to non-sexual roleplaying games</summary>
Roleplaying is a popular and legitimate form of gameplay on Roblox. Only explicit adult or inappropriate roleplay scenarios would be flagged.
</details>

<details>
<summary>General profanity or non-sexual insults</summary>
These are better handled by existing chat filters and standard moderation tools. Focusing on these would affect the tool's primary purpose of detecting safety concerns.
</details>

## ‚ö° Efficiency

Rotector is designed to be highly efficient in processing large volumes of data while maintaining reasonable resource usage. Below is a performance snapshot from one of our test runs (as of November 7, 2024).

> [!NOTE]
> These results are from a single test run and should be considered illustrative rather than definitive. Performance can vary significantly based on multiple factors like API response times, proxy performance, system resources, configuration, and more.

### Test Configuration

- Users to Scan: 500
- Workers: 3 AI friend workers
- Proxies: 250 Romanian Location
- Rate Limit: 200 requests/second

### Performance Metrics

| Metric                              | Value                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Time Taken                          | 44 minutes 32 seconds |
| **Accounts Flagged**                | **7,078**             |
| API Requests Sent                   | 74,243                |
| API Request Success Rate            | 99.86%                |
| Bandwidth Used                      | 753.48 MB             |
| OpenAI Token Cost                   | $0.16                 |
| OpenAI API Calls                    | 241                   |
| Redis Memory Usage                  | 803.92 MB             |
| Redis Key Count                     | 69,663                |
| Concurrent Goroutines (min/avg/max) | 335 / 2,428 / 4,454   |

> [!NOTE]
> At this rate, a 24-hour runtime would theoretically flag approximately **228,869 users** with AI costs of $5.17. However, the actual number of flagged users would likely decrease over time as more users are added to the database, since previously processed users would not need to be rechecked.

### Accuracy Validation

In a manual review of 100 randomly selected flagged users from this test run:

- 99 users were confirmed as correctly flagged
- 1 user was cleared due to insufficient profile information

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary>What's the story behind Rotector?</summary>

Rotector began with its creator, [jaxron](https://github.com/jaxron), developing two foundational libraries on September 23, 2024: [RoAPI.go](https://github.com/jaxron/roapi.go) and [axonet](https://github.com/jaxron/axonet). These libraries became the backbone of Rotector's networking and API interaction capabilities.

Rotector's official development secretly started on October 13, 2024, driven by his personal concerns about the growing problem of inappropriate behavior and content on the Roblox platform, and with the ambitious goal to protect younger players from potential predators. The project was officially open-sourced for alpha testing on November 8, 2024.

While Roblox has its own moderation system, the platform's massive user base makes it difficult to quickly identify every inappropriate account. Some Roblox staff have also acknowledged the challenge of moderating users due to the high volume of reports. Even after being reported, inappropriate accounts‚Äîincluding those potentially belonging to predators‚Äîoften remain active.

By automating the detection process, Rotector aims to simplify this process and enable quicker identification of potentially inappropriate accounts. We want to contribute to the current moderating efforts and give the Roblox community‚Äîespecially its younger members‚Äîan extra level of security.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is Rotector open-sourced?</summary>

We believe in transparency and the power of open source. By making our code public, anyone can understand how the tool works. This project also serves as a learning resource for those interested in online safety and moderation technologies.

While we welcome feedback and suggestions, please note that this open-source release is primarily for informational and educational purposes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why don't you provide setup instructions for Rotector?</summary>

We deliberately don't provide detailed setup instructions for Rotector due to several important reasons:

1. **Complex Setup**: Setting up and maintaining Rotector is a complex process that requires professional expertise and is not designed for casual use or inexperienced users.

2. **Preventing Misuse**: We hope to prevent potential misuse of the tool. This is due to the fact that providing easy instructions could allow the very groups we're trying to combat (such as ERPers) to exploit or circumvent the system.

3. **Resource Intensiveness**: Rotector requires computational resources and infrastructure to run effectively, which may not be simple for individual users or small organizations.

If you represent a business, organization or you are a developer that needs to set up and use Rotector for legitimate purposes, please contact us directly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When will the REST API be available?</summary>

The REST API will be available during beta phase. In the current alpha phase, the project is focused on core functionality including worker capabilities and the reviewing system. Once these foundational features are stable, we'll begin work on the public API that will allow developers to integrate Rotector's capabilities into their own applications.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use Rotector without the Discord bot?</summary>

Although the Discord bot is essential for the easy review and moderation of detected accounts, Rotector's primary features (identifying and reporting accounts with workers) can function on their own. If you decide not to use the Discord bot, you would have to implement another method for reviewing detected accounts. This could involve directly querying the database or creating a custom interface for reviewing detected accounts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why use Discord instead of a custom web interface?</summary>

Discord's bot framework provides all the functionality needed for efficient review processes, including buttons, dropdowns, forms, and rich embeds. Using Discord also allows us to focus our development efforts on core features rather than spending time building and maintaining a custom frontend.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are proxies and cookies necessary to use Rotector?</summary>

No, proxies and cookies are not required to use Rotector. Proxies can be helpful for distributed requests and avoiding rate limits when making many requests. However, while cookies are mentioned in the configuration, they are not currently used for anything in the project.

You can configure proxies in the `config.toml` file if needed. This configuration file also includes a rate limiter setting, which allows you to control the frequency of requests to the Roblox API.

<summary>Will users who have stopped their inappropriate behavior be removed from the database?</summary>

No, past rule violations remain in the database, even if a user claims that they have changed their ways. This can be useful for law enforcement investigations and for future safety concerns. Additionally, some users try to clean their reputation temporarily, only to resume their actions later.

This isn't about preventing forgiveness, but rather about maintaining accountability. The records serve as a crucial part of our ongoing efforts to keep the platform safe for all users, especially minors.

<summary>Who inspired the creation of Rotector?</summary>

[Ruben Sim](https://www.youtube.com/@RubenSim), a YouTuber and former game developer, helped inspire Rotector through his dedicated work exposing Roblox's moderation issues. His efforts running the [Moderation for Dummies](https://x.com/ModForDummies) Twitter account, which consistently posts verified ERP accounts, showed what dedicated individuals can achieve even without technical resources or official support. We are deeply grateful for his contributions which helped pave the way for our project.
